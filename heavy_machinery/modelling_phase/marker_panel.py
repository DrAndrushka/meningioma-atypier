"""Which MRI markers, and do they combine? — the two study aims, in one place.

The report's EDA section already scores every marker on its own, and the
threshold phase already knows how to compare a combined rule against a single
one. What is missing is a place where those two answers sit side by side on one
patient set, in the report that actually gets read.

Nothing here re-implements an estimator that already exists. The combination
machinery is :mod:`combinations` from the threshold phase, reached through a
nine-line adapter; the model scoring is :mod:`model_calculator`. The only new
statistic is the positive likelihood ratio, which is what turns "most specific"
into a question with a defensible answer — a sign that is never seen is
perfectly specific and perfectly useless.

    nothing. The interval is Katz's, computed on the log scale because a ratio
    bounded below by zero and unbounded above is not symmetric.
